**提示词**: Age-related susceptibility to sepsis and endotoxemia is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system and the expansion of the visceral adipose as an immunological reservoir are underlying features. Macrophages from older organisms exhibit substantial changes, including chronic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, genomic remodeling and a dysfunctional, amplified inflammatory response upon new exposure to pathogen. However, the mechanisms by which old macrophages maintain their inflammatory phenotype during endotoxemia remains elusive. We previously identified Gdf3 , a TGFβ superfamily cytokine, as a top-regulated gene by age and the NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Here, we demonstrate that endotoxemia increases inflammatory (CD11c + ) ATMs in a Gdf3- dependent manner in old mice. Lifelong systemic or myeloid-specific deletion of Gdf3 leads to reduced endotoxemia- induced inflammation, with decreased CD11c + ATMs and inflammatory cytokines, and protection from hypothermia. Moreover, acute blockade of Gdf3 using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, phenocopies old mice with lifelong Gdf3- deficiency. We show that GDF3 promotes the inflammatory phenotype in ATMs by phosphorylating SMAD2/3. Mechanistically, the differential chromatin landscape of ATMs from old mice with or without myeloid-driven Gdf3 indicates that GDF3- SMAD2/3 signaling axis shifts the chromatin accessibility of ATMs towards an inflammatory state during aging. Furthermore, pharmaceutical inhibition of SMAD3 with a specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3) mimics Gdf3 deletion. SIS3 reduces endotoxemia-mediated inflammation with fewer CD11c + ATMs and less severe hypothermia in old, but not young mice, as well as reduced mortality. In human adipose tissue, age positively correlates with GDF3 level, while inflammation correlates with pSMAD2/3 level. Overall, these results highlight the importance of GDF3-SMAD2/3 axis in driving inflammation in older organisms and identify this signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target for mitigating endotoxemia-related inflammation in the aged.

**提示词**: Septic cardiomyopathy is a life-threatening heart dysfunction caused by severe infection. Considering the complexity of pathogenesis and high mortality, the identification of efficient biomarkers are needed to guide clinical practice. Based on multimicroarray analysis, this study aimed to explore the pathogenesis of septic cardiomyopathy and the related immune landscape. The results showed that septic cardiomyopathy resulted in organ dysfunction due to extreme pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. In this process, KLRG1, PRF1, BCL6, GAB2, MMP9, IL1R1, JAK3, IL6ST, and SERPINE1 were identified as the hub genes regulating the immune landscape of septic cardiomyopathy. Nine transcription factors regulated the expression of these genes: SRF, STAT1, SP1, RELA, PPARG, NFKB1, PPARA, SMAD3, and STAT3. The hub genes activated the Th17 cell differentiation pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and cytokine‒cytokine receptor interaction pathway. These pathways were mainly involved in regulating the inflammatory response, adaptive immune response, leukocyte-mediated immunity, cytokine-mediated immunity, immune effector processes, myeloid cell differentiation, and T-helper cell differentiation. These nine hub genes could be considered biomarkers for the early prediction of septic cardiomyopathy.

**提示词**: Sepsis is a serious inflammatory disease caused by bacterial infection. Cardiovascular dysfunction and remodeling are serious complications of sepsis, which can significantly affect sepsis patients' mortality. Delta-like homologue 1 (DLK1) has been reported could inhibit cardiac myofibroblast differentiation. However, the function of DLK1 in sepsis is unknown. In the present study, the DLK1 expression was first identified based on the online dataset GSE79962 analysis and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model. DLK1 expression was significantly reduced in septic heart tissues. In septic mouse heart, CLP operation decreased the fractional shortening (EF) (%) and ejection fraction (FS) (%) and caused significant edema, disordered myofilament arrangement, and degradation and necrosis in myocardial cells; CLP operation also increased collagen deposition and elevated the protein levels of fibrotic markers (α-SMA and F-actin). DLK1 overexpression in septic mice could effectively increase EF (%) and FS (%), attenuate CLP-caused ECM degradation and deposition and partially inhibit the CLP-induced TGF-β1/Smad signaling activation. In conclusion, DLK1 expression was poorly expressed in the CLP-induced septic mouse heart. DLK1 overexpression partially alleviated sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis, with the involvement of the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway and MMPs.

**提示词**: Background: Sepsis is a major clinical challenge, with in-hospital mortality of 25%-40% in intensive care unit patients. The gastrointestinal tract is recognized as both the "initiating organ" of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and the "central organ" in orchestrating the host stress response during critical illness. ACSL4, a regulator of lipid metabolism and ferroptosis, is a potential target for sepsis-induced intestinal injury, but its inhibitor parishin has not been evaluated in this context. Methods: Key genes implicated in sepsis pathogenesis were identified through bioinformatic analysis of publicly available datasets from the GEO. Network pharmacology approaches were used to screen for small-molecule compounds with high binding affinity to the identified hub genes. Molecular docking, followed by in vivo and in vitro validation, was employed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and mechanistic impact of the top candidate compound in a murine sepsis model. Results: Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis identified five genes most significantly associated with sepsis diagnosis. Protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed 157 hub genes, among which ACSL4 was the sole gene shared across diagnostic and functional modules. Molecular docking analysis indicated that Parishin exhibited the strongest binding affinity to ACSL4 (docking score: -17.701). In septic animal models, ACSL4 expression was markedly upregulated in both plasma monocytes and intestinal tissues (P < 0.05), accompanied by increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation (LPO), MDA, and Fe2+ (P < 0.05). Expression of ferroptosis-associated proteins was also evidently elevated (P < 0.05). Treatment with Parishin notably attenuated these pathological changes, reduced ferroptosis-related markers, and improved 72-hour survival rates in septic mice (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Parishin ameliorates sepsis-induced intestinal injury by downregulating ACSL4 expression, thereby inhibiting Smad3 phosphorylation and suppressing ferroptosis. These findings suggest that ACSL4 is a promising therapeutic target for mitigating intestinal damage in sepsis.

**提示词**: Introduction: Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of sepsis, which is a severe inflammatory disease with high mortality. The TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway plays an important role in the progression of sepsis, and targeting the TGF-β receptor II (TGFBR2) has been shown to ameliorate its effects. Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 11 (USP11) stabilizes TGFBR2 and enhances the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. In this study, we evaluated the effects of USP11 inhibition on sepsis-associated AKI. Methods: A septic mouse model was established and treated with the USP11 inhibitor mitoxantrone. The expression of TGFBR2, phosphorylation of Smad3, as well as the levels of kidney injury markers, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers, were measured in kidney tissues. Results: Elevated expressions of TGFBR2 and phosphorylated Smad3 were detected in the kidneys of septic mice, and mitoxantrone treatment was found to reduce the expression of TGFBR2 while suppressing the activation of Smad3. The drug also attenuated kidney injury while reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidneys of septic mice. Conclusion: USP11 inhibition by mitoxantrone ameliorated sepsis-associated AKI by downregulating TGFBR2/Smad3 signaling.

**提示词**: Background: Sepsis-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is a major contributor to mortality in septic patients. Exploring the pathogenesis and developing effective treatment strategies for sepsis-induced ALI is critical for improving patient outcomes. Dachengqi decoction (DCQD), which is a classic Chinese herbal medicine, has been shown to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of DCQD against sepsis-induced ALI remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of DCQD on sepsis-induced ALI and elucidate the involvement of the TGF-1β/Smad3 pathways. Methods: A septic mouse model was established using caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to evaluate the protective effect of DCQD on sepsis-induced ALI in vivo. An in vitro cellular inflammation model was established using LPS-stimulated LO2 cells to further investigate the underlying mechanism. Results: DCQD (2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 g/kg body weight) was administered twice daily for 2 days and exerted a dose-dependent protective effect against sepsis-induced ALI. DCQD treatment significantly inhibited inappropriate inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in liver tissue. Moreover, DCQD maintained liver homeostasis by inhibiting hepatocyte apoptosis and improving sepsis-induced liver damage. In vivo and in vitro studies indicated that the TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling pathway played an important role in sepsis-induced ALI, and DCQD treatment significantly inhibited the activation of this pathway. Conclusions: DCQD can effectively suppress excessive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, leading to a substantial reduction in hepatocyte apoptosis in sepsis-induced ALI.
